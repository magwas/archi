	<p>Archi is a free, open source, cross-platform tool to create ArchiMate models.</p>
    
	<p><a href="http://www.archimate.org/">ArchiMate</a><sup><a href="appendix.html">1</a></sup> is an open and independent Enterprise Architecture modelling language that supports the description, analysis and visualization of architecture within and across business domains. ArchiMate is one of the open standards hosted by <a href="http://www.opengroup.org/" target="_blank">The Open Group</a><sup>1</sup> and is fully aligned with <a href="http://www.opengroup.org/togaf/" target="_new">TOGAF</a><sup>1</sup>.</p>
    
	<p><strong>Archi</strong> is targeted toward all levels of Enterprise Architects and Enterprise Modellers. It is intended to provide a low cost to entry (i.e. free) solution to users who may be making their first steps in the ArchiMate language or who are looking for a cross-platform ArchiMate modelling tool for their company or institution. Archi fulfils the needs of most Enterprise Architects and associated stakeholders, but it can also be regarded as an introductory ArchiMate tool for those wishing to engage with the language before committing to a commercial solution.</p>
    
	<p>Since its introduction, Archi has been widely adopted for real-world use in the commercial and educational sectors and is used in-house  by major global companies and consultants. It is rapidly becoming the <em>de facto</em> open source ArchiMate modelling tool.</p>
    
	<p>The development of Archi has been funded by the <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/">Jisc</a> and has been developed by Phil Beauvoir.</p>
